Fish Weight Prediction
This project is a web application that predicts the weight of a fish based on its length, height, width, and species. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of fish characteristics.

Features
Input Form: Users can input the fish's length, height, width, and select the species.
Prediction: The application returns the predicted weight of the fish.
Model: The application uses a linear regression model trained with scikit-learn.
